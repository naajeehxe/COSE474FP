# Effective Fine tuning and prompt engineering to enhance CLIP performance for Dog Emotion recognition



### Initially, my objective was to fine-tune the CLIP model for a classification task distinguishing between Normal and Pneumonia cases in Chest X-rays.

### However, the subtlety in visual differences between Normal presentations and Pneumonia in these X-rays posed significant challenges. This minimal contrast limited the effectiveness of performance enhancements, even after fine-tuning, particularly in the context of Zero-shot learning applications.

### Consequently, I shifted my focus to a task involving the classification of Dog Emotions. This pivot allowed me to experiment with a range of prompts, aiming to enhance CLIP's learning of the intricate relationships between images and text. I also pursued fine-tuning on the Dog Emotion Dataset, intending to achieve a noticeable improvement in performance metrics.
